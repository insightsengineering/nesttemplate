# nesttemplate

## Overview

`nesttemplate` provides a custom [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org) template for NEST packages.
Please donâ€™t use it for your own package.

In order to take full advantage of that template you would need to use `pkgdown` >= 2.0.0.

## Templates

Please ensure that the `_pkgdown.yml` file contains:

```yaml
template:
    package: nesttemplate
```
